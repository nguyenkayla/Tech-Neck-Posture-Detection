# CS328 Project: Tech Neck Posture Detection
Names: Meghan Duddu, Maria Mechery, Kayla Nguyen

What is the project about?
This project is called “Tech Neck Posture Detection”. In the growing age of technology and cell-phone usage, there has been a great increase in bad neck posture (“tech neck”) among individuals, which has been leading to neck pain, headaches, and many more health concerns. The purpose of our project is to be able to test various extents of poor neck posture and see the trends between them. We are going to be able to track the differences in movements using Apple Airpods via the Sensor Logger app. We will be able to obtain the motion data during each of the following three positions: proper posture, mild forward head posture, and severe forward head posture. The goal is to create a machine learning classifier to be able to detect the difference between the healthy and unhealthy neck posture of a user based on the motion data provided. If it is successful, then it will be able to successfully detect when a user’s head/neck is in an unhealthy position for a long time, which could help prevent neck pain and other serious health issues that could develop in the long-term future.

Why is this project exciting for you and your group?
This project is exciting for us because we wanted to analyze a device that we all have experience in. Each of us have utilized AirPods and its audio extensively and it would be interesting to further learn more about this device. We also love using Sensor Logger for its easy user interface and informative instructions, therefore, we wanted to continue using it for our final project idea. Body posture is also an important health concern and something that we want to analyze to better improve not only our health, but help inform others about it.

Who are the team members, and what are their roles?
Meghan Duddu:
Record own data using Sensor Logger for each of predefined postures
Project Manager: Divides up work into achievable tasks
Maria Mechery:
Record own data using Sensor Logger for each of predefined postures
Time Management: Makes sure parts of the project are getting completed in an efficient, timely manner
Kayla Nguyen:
Record own data using Sensor Logger for each of predefined postures
Quality Overseer: Ensures that the work being produced is up to par for the project

What are the milestones and deliverables?
Our first milestone is for each team member to collect sensor data for the three posture positions using the Sensor Logger App and our airpods utilizing the accelerometer and gyroscope settings. Our next milestone would be to clean and label each of the collected data and conduct an exploratory data analysis to visualize sensor data patterns and identify differences between postures. This analysis will help us summarize key statistics and guide the development of our machine learning model. Our third milestone would be to create and train the classifier based on the information gathered from the previous milestones. Lastly we would test our model, evaluate the models accuracy and report our final findings. For the deliverables we would include our raw and processed sensor data, the code used for analysis and model development and a final report.
